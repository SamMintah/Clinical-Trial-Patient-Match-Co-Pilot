      "briefSummary": "HER2 is highly expressed on the surface of several cancer types, including breast and gastric/gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancers. Several commercially available HER2-directed oncology therapies exist; however, most patients who initially derive meaningful clinical benefit from these agents eventually relapse or experience disease progression. Accordingly, the development of safe and effective treatments for patients who have exhausted current HER2-directed options remains an important unmet medical need.\n\nAB-201 has demonstrated direct, HER2-specific, and potent cytotoxicity against multiple tumor cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, AB-201 has shown the ability to secrete cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), upon activation. Based on this emerging HER2-targeted cell therapy dataset, a HER2 CAR-NK therapy such as AB-201 may offer a safe, active, and readily available treatment option for patients with HER2-positive solid tumors.\n\nThis clinical trial will enroll subjects with HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancers. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of AB-201 in subjects with advanced HER2-positive gastric/GEJ cancers.

      "phase": "Phase 2",
      "briefSummary": "Neoadjuvant or primary systemic treatment is increasingly applied in the treatment of operable breast cancer. Down staging of the primary tumor is one of the important goals of neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment (NCT), thereby permitting breast-conserving treatment without affecting the risk for a local relapse. Complete pathological response (pCR) rates after NCT vary across histological subtypes and can be more than 60% in HER2-positive disease with dual blockade therapy. Down staging of the axilla is also observed in patients initially presenting with metastatic lymph nodes. pCR rates in the axilla vary between 22% and 42% in reported series, again depending on tumor subtype. Omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can avoid the post-operative morbidity such as lymphedema in the short or long term follow-up.\n\nMetastatic lymph node status is hard to be stated as a pCR in the axilla by using physical examination or imaging such as ultrasonography or tomography after complete NCT. Good response to the axilla lymph node causing the difficulty of tissue proof by using core needle biopsy, though the investigator knew that biopsy stands for the definite tool for the confirmation of the residual disease. One proposed method to decrease the false-negative rate (FNR) is clip placement in the positive node at initial diagnosis with confirmation of clipped node resection at surgery.\n\nThe correlation between the axillary lymph node identified on initial axillary ultrasound and the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) identified at surgery has not been fully evaluated. The concordance between percutaneous biopsy and the lymph node resected at the time of SLNB is not 100%. Sometimes, the initial node identified by ultrasound is not one of the SLNs. The impairment of the performance of SLNB might correlated to the alteration of lymphatic flow induced by tissue fibrosis or tumor deposits after NCT.\n\nThe investigator hypothesized that the clip placement at diagnosis of node-positive disease with removal of the clipped node during SLNB reduces the FNR of SLNB after NCT. Here, we evaluate how often the lymph node containing the clip placed at percutaneous biopsy before chemotherapy was found at surgery to be one of the SLNs, and how often it was found in the nodes retrieved at ALND. In addition, the investigator report the impact of identification of the clipped node within the SLNs on the FNR of SLNB.",

      "phase": "Phase 2",
      "briefSummary": "The emerging paradigm of person-centered medicine has resulted in a change in the approach and management of health needs, and the introduction of new models and tools into clinical practice. One important change is the introduction of quality of life measurement (HRQoL). The tools used, however, remain anchored in a purely quantitative model, which does not enter the person's specific identity and emotional territory. The perception of quality of life is highly subjective, anchored in each person's needs and expectations (relative deprivation). The structured integration of the patient's point of view can be strengthened by the introduction of narrative medicine and qualitative methodologies, which enrich the point of view expressed in a standardized way, favoring person-centered care and not categories of patients.\n\nThe National Chronicity Plan (2016) promotes the application of narrative medicine in clinical practice, aiming at the personalization of care: \"the patient-person and his or her individual 'global' health project built through a personalized and shared 'Care Pact' that considers not only his or her clinical condition, but also the life context in which the disease is experienced\".\n\nThe current spread of digital tools in health care can facilitate the integration of qualitative and quantitative components through the use of dedicated platforms.\n\nIn breast cancer patients with advanced disease, especially with triple-negative and HER2-negative biological subtype, oncological treatments include chemotherapy regimens, without or with target therapies and biological treatments combined with endocrinotherapy. For these patients, there is a need to improve treatment-related outcomes and overall quality of care and quality of life. To date, there is a lack of detection of subjective experience on an ongoing basis, which is the basis for personalization of care, and which may also have an impact on adherence to cancer treatment.\n\nThe study aims to evaluate the introduction of the digital Person based Care (PbC) model designed by the project team. The model uses an online platform to integrate HRQoL quantitative data and qualitative narrative data for personalized care pathway based on the daily needs and existential project of the patient/caregiver.",

      "briefSummary": "Aromatase inhibitor (AI) + CDK4/6 inhibitor is settled down as the standard first line therapy for HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and all three CDk4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are currently available for same indications. However, there is no effective treatment strategy for patients who have progressed on AI+CDK4/6 inhibitor. In particular, the clinical efficacies of subsequent hormone therapy are lowered when ESR1 mutations, one of mechanisms of AI resistance occur. In the PADA-1 trial, when ESR1 mutations in ctDNA were detected in patients treated with AI+CDK4/6 inhibitor, AI was switched to fulvestrant even if disease progression was not confirmed clinically. As a result, the median PFS was prolonged by about 8 months in this switching group compared to the group in which AI was continued. The results of this study suggested that delaying the occurrence of ESR1 mutations and early response to them are necessary to increase the effectiveness of hormone therapy.\n\nIn SWOG S0226 study, fulvestrant + AI combination showed significant benefits in PFS and OS compared to AI monotherapy as the first line therapy. Based on these results, the NCCN guideline suggests fulvestrant + AI combination as one of the first line hormone therapy options. However, the clinical effect of AI + fulvestrant + CDK4/6 inhibitor has not been investigated yet. Therefore, the investigators are planning to compare the clinical efficacy of AI+ fulvestrant + CDK4/6 inhibitor and AI+CDK4/6 inhibitor, and to investigate if a triple combination regimen can delay the emergence of ESR1 mutations and modulate occurred ESR1 mutations.",

This antibody binds to cell receptors known as the HER2/neu tyrosine kinase receptor. These receptors are expressed in certain cancer subtypes such as breast cancer. By blocking signaling through this HER2/neu receptor, trastuzumab can slow down or stop the over-expression of the HER2/neu protein. Over-expression of HER2/neu has been shown to play a role in the development and progression of certain types of breast cancer.

Biological therapies, such as talimogene laherparepvec, use substances made from living organisms that may attack specific tumor cells and stop them from growing or kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Drugs used as endocrine therapy, such as letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane, tamoxifen or fulvestrant, may lessen the amount of estrogen made by the body or may may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking estrogen from connecting to the cancer cells.

      "phase": "Phase NA",
      "briefSummary": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is standard treatment for many triple-negative (TNBC) and HER2-positive breast cancer. Study showed about half of the biopsy-proven axillary disease will be eradicated by NACT and converted to ypN0 indicating the efficacy of systemic treatment in local disease control.\n\nAccording to current guidelines, all initial cN0 patients will undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NACT and further axillary dissection (ALND) if tumor residual is discovered after SLNB. Data suggest patients who underwent SLNB have a significantly higher rate of disability in the early post-operative period compared to patients who did not and the avoidance of SLNB might translate into a considerable reduction of physical and emotional distress. Recent studies revealed the association between breast pCR and ypN0 status after NACT. Initially cN0 TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer patients who achieve pCR in breast after NACT have a very low risk of positive lymph node residual and are very unlikely to benefit from further axillary surgery including SLNB.\n\nThe investigators designed a clinical trial to test the hypothesis that selective omission of axillary surgery in distinct responders after NACT will not deteriorate survival. In the planned trial, axillary surgery will be completely eliminated for initially cN0 TNBC and HER2-positive breast cancer patients who achieve pCR in breast after NACT determined by lumpectomy.\n\nThe trial is designed as a prospective, single-center, single-arm study with a limited number of patients (N=136). Patients will be recruited in China over a period of 36 months. Our results, together with other ongoing studies in other parts of the world with a similar design, might give practice-changing results and spare the time and the costs of a randomized comparison.",

      "title": "Pharmacokinetic Boosting of Olaparib to Improve Exposure, Tolerance and Cost-effectiveness",
      "phase": "Phase 4",
      "briefSummary": "Olaparib is a poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, originally used for the maintenance treatment of women with platinum-sensitive relapsed breast cancer gene (BRCA)-mutated high grade serious epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, who are in response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Over the last two years, several therapeutic indications have been added to the drug label, such as first-line platinum-sensitive BRCA-mutated high grade serious epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, germline BRCA1/2-mutated, human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2-)negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and BRCA1/2-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who have progressed following prior therapy. Since olaparib is very expensive, this increase of treatment population will have a significant impact on health care expenditures.\n\nTo keep healthcare affordable and accessible for all patients, innovative strategies are warranted to reduce the dose of expensive drugs, without reduction of efficacy. For olaparib, pharmacokinetic (PK) boosting can be applied. PK boosting is the lay term for administering a non-therapeutic active strong inhibitor of a metabolic enzyme, for example the cytochrome p450 enzyme 3A (CYP3A), together with a therapeutic drug that is metabolized by the same enzyme. Boosting thus increases the concentration of the therapeutic drug and allows lower doses to be administered to patients. Hence, coadministration of a reduced dose of olaparib with cobicistat, a non-therapeutic, strong inhibitor of the CYP3A can lead to equivalent exposure to olaparib. Furthermore, inhibition of CYP3A could lead to less PK variability since metabolic capacity is a prominent cause for (intra- and inter-individual) variability in systemic exposure. Predictable olaparib exposure will reduce the number of patients who are unintentionally under- or overtreated. Lastly, tumor tissue itself may express CYP3A as a detoxification or resistance mechanism. Theoretically, PK boosting may also overcome CYP3A-mediated drug resistance.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy, safety and feasibility of co-administering olaparib with the PK booster cobicistat with the aim to implement boosting approach for olaparib in routine practice. The study is subdivided in two parts. In part A of the study the equivalent exposure of boosted low dose olaparib is determined compared to the normal dose. In part B of the study, non-inferiority of the boosted olaparib regimen will be confirmed.",

      "briefSummary": "Currently most breast cancer patients with confirmed axillary lymph node metastasis (cN1) at diagnosis are candidates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The increased utilization of NAC can be attributed to practical clinical advantages. The increasing use of NAC has, however, introduced questions regarding appropriate loco-regional management, including the optimal surgical approach to the axillary lymph nodes.\n\nAccording to current guidelines, patients presenting with cN1 disease and treated with NAC, still undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). In forty percent of these patients, however, the investigators see a nodal complete pathological response (ypN0). In certain subgroups, triple negative breast cancer and Her2 amplified breast cancer, this percentage is even higher. The investigators would like to lessen surgical morbidity by performing a targeted axillary dissection. The investigators place a clip in the biopsy-proven lymph node metastasis at diagnosis. After NAC, the investigators perform a dual agent sentinel node procedure and remove the clipped node during the same surgery. When these lymph nodes are microscopically tumor-free, the investigators can abolish an ALND. Targeted axillary dissection after NAC for cN1 disease seems to have acceptable false negative rates in previous trials. The investigators would like to further define patients where an ALND can be safely omitted.",

      "briefSummary": "Significant progress has been made in the treatment of women with Her2 positive breast cancer who are treated with trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits Her2. Despite this progress not all patients with Her2 positive metastatic breast cancer respond to trastuzumab and patients with metastatic disease who do respond usually develop progressive disease during treatment with trastuzumab. The mechanism of such resistance is unknown. We propose to investigate the mechanism of trastuzumab resistance in Her2 positive breast cancer. The hypothesis to be examined in the basic science section of this study is that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are modifiers of HER2 signaling and that these adapter proteins could be predictive indicators of treatment response to Herceptin in patients that are candidates for this targeted therapy. The connection between IRS-1 and IRS-2 expression and Herceptin response and clinical outcome in HER2 positive human breast tumors will be evaluated to determine if IRS expression correlates with resistance to Herceptin therapy and with the aggressive behavior of these tumors. This study will establish if the IRS proteins influence HER2 function in tumors and if they are predictive markers for evaluating treatment options for HER2 positive patients.",

      "phase": "Phase 2",
      "briefSummary": "Introduction: Many reimbursement authorities use economic evaluation to help guide decisions regarding the adoption of new treatments in reimbursement systems. Survival and quality of life are often the main measure of benefit used in an economic evaluation - expressed as a quality adjusted life year (QALY). In addition though, some decision makers will also consider the impact of a treatment on a patient's ability to continue working (expressed in terms of productivity). The aim of the present study is to estimate quality of life weights (utilities) and productivity loss for women with metastatic breast cancer (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 positive or HER 2+).\n\nMethods: Separate surveys will be used to assess utilities and productivity in HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC). To capture utilities health state descriptions or vignettes describing progressive disease, stable disease, and seven grade 3/4 adverse events (diarrhoea, fatigue, anaemia, leukopenia, anorexia, decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and skin rash) will be developed. The vignettes will be developed based on a literature review and in depth interviews with women with MBC in the Netherlands and Sweden. Clinical experts in both countries will review the health states for content validity. The health states will be translated using forward and back translation. Members of the general public will rate the states (100 men and women in NL; 100 women aged 50+ in Sweden) using the visual analogue scale and Time Trade Off method to determine utility values. In a separate survey women who are currently being treated or have recently completed their treatment for MBC will be surveyed regarding the impact of disease on their ability to work using a validated work productivity measure (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment) in women in the Netherlands and Sweden.",

In Stage 2, patients without disease progression will be assigned to different treatment strategies based on the percentage reduction in mean ctDNA VAF.\n\nThe study aims to assess whether ctDNA VAF dynamics can serve as an early biomarker to guide treatment intensification and improve clinical outcomes in metastatic breast cancer.",
